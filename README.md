## Problem statement
A set of wooden blocks of various shapes and colors are sitting on a table. The goal is to build one or more vertical stacks of blocks. The catch is that only one block may be moved at a time: it may either be placed on the table or placed atop another block. Because of this, any blocks that are, at a given time, under another block cannot be moved.

  - **Initial state :** Given configuration of blocks and a set of block stacks.
  
  - **Actions and transitions :** Move block from the top of one stack onto the table or onto the top of another stack.

  - **Goal :** A given final configuration of the stacks of blocks.
